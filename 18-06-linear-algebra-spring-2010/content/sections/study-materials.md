NOTE: More material on linear algebra (and much more about differential equations) is in Professor Strang's 2014 textbook _[Differential Equations and Linear Algebra](http://www-math.mit.edu/~gs/dela)_. In 2016, the textbook was developed into a series of 55 short videos,Â _[Learn Differential Equations: Up Close with Gilbert Strang and Cleve Moler](/resources/res-18-009-learn-differential-equations-up-close-with-gilbert-strang-and-cleve-moler-fall-2015/index.htm)._
